                <h1>Mother Nature is our muse. Building on her handiwork, weâ€™re finding new uses for materials that exist right in front of us. Like wool from merino sheep, who have the best hair in nature.</h1>
                <p>
                But even great locks need a trim from time to time. With fibers that are 20% the diameter of human hair, our superfine merino wool is breathable, temperature-regulating, and moisture-wicking, all without that irritating scratchiness.
